 Password Generator

## Description

This project works on the JavaScript progame to generate a random password based application. The app runs in the browser, and will allow the user to interact with the app based on choices.
The user will choose from a series of the following prompts to create their random passowrd:

* Length of password
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)

This project uses fucntions divided into three main parts to execute the final user input.
I have used a combination of prompts and conditional statements and loops that tailors the requirements to the user options for their random password.
